This is a simple demo to practice nodejs.

## How to run this demo 
1. first step,you should make sure you have installed nodejs run environment
2. start the backend server
   cd back-end
   node index.js
   and you will find it that the srever is runing on port 8080
3. then you can change directory into front-end, open the index.html by using broswers


This is just a demo by using raw nodejs, and I am not very familiar with node, so it is just a simple demo.
There are some errors in project and it is not very complete enough.
